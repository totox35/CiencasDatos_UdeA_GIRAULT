I would like to work on predicting air pollution peaks in Paris by combining air quality, weather, and traffic data.  
For air quality, I can use datasets such as the [World Air Quality Data 2024 (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/world-air-quality-data-2024-updated/data) or [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/).  
For weather information, I plan to use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).  
Finally, for traffic data, I can rely on the [Paris Open Data traffic sensors](opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/comptages-routiers-permanents/table/?disjunctive.libelle&disjunctive.libelle_nd_amont&disjunctive.libelle_nd_aval&disjunctive.etat_trafic&sort=t_1h).

I plan to count the total flux of Paris by day (at least, big road axis), and to combine it with the air quality and weather condition to better understand and predict pollution peaks.
